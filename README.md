# Alexa-Sentiment-Analysis
This project uses TensorFlow, a popular deep learning framework, to perform sentiment analysis on Amazon Alexa product reviews. The dataset used for this analysis contains reviews and ratings for the Amazon Alexa product and it's different variations, the goal was to classify reviews as either positive or negative based on the feedback provided by users.

Technologies/Frameworks Used:
- Python
- TensorFlow and Keras for Deep Learning
- Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib for data analysis and visualization.

The primary aim of this project was to get a more hands-on experience in the fields of deep learning and machine learning. By applying these techniques to real-world data, i was able to learn about the general workflows that are involved in the whole machine/deep learning process while improving my skills in two very popular frameworks, TensorFlow and Keras.
